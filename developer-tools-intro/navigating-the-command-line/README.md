# Navigating the Command Line

## Navigating the Command Line

We can perform actions using the command line by **entering commands**. There is a command to perform virtually any action you can imagine on your computer! There are commands to open an application, create new files, copy files from one place to another, and more.

Go ahead and open up Terminal using any of the following methods:

1\) Navigate to your Applications folder, and double click on "Terminal."

2\) Press Command + Space on your keyboard to bring up Spotlight â€” a tool that allows you to quickly find files and applications on our computer. Inside the search bar, type "Terminal," and select the Terminal application.

Let's start typing commands together. In your open terminal window, type `hello?` and press "enter:"

```text
$ hello?
```

Your terminal should respond \(rudely\):

```text
-bash: hello?: command not found
```

This is how your computer tells you that it does not understand the command you've entered. Remember, we have left the GUI world behind us, so we will no longer have pretty warning messages and alert boxes. But don't worry! In due time, as we grow more comfortable in this new environment, even these cryptic messages will be as clear as any warning box you'll ever see.

Try typing this into your terminal:

```text
$ Where am I?
```

Again, we get a similar response:

```text
-bash: Where: command not found
```

Great. We've established that our command line doesn't understand plain English, and that we'll have to use special words while writing our commands. Let's try this one to start:

```text
$ pwd
```

Whoa! It looks like our computer understood that one! It replied with a message similar to this one:

```text
/Users/corneliusfinch
```

\(Note: On your machine, you should have seen `corneliusfinch` replaced with your username!\)

If you're following along in **Git Bash on Windows**, the message will look similar but with some slight differences:

```text
/c/Users/corneliusfinch
```

So, what did we just do?

The command `pwd` stands for "Print Working Directory."

We use this command when we want the command line to tell us which folder \(or directory\) of our computer we're currently in.

Just like the Finder on a Mac, your command line interface \(CLI\) places you in a particular folder on your computer. `pwd` tells you where you're currently located in your file system. Usually, when you open a terminal application, you start off in your "home folder," which shares the name of your username on your computer.

If we were using Finder, we'd be able to see the files and folders that are present in this folder. In a CLI, however, if we want to see the files and folders in our current location, we need to ask for that using another command.

Let's find out which files are in our current folder.

```text
$ ls
```

Lo and behold, the folder's contents are:

```text
Applications       Desktop          Documents
Downloads          Library          Movies
Music              Pictures         Public
```

\(Note: Again, on your own machine, because you may have different files and folders, you may see additional items when you enter `ls`!\)

If you're following along in **Git Bash on Windows**, it's alright if the files and folders listed out look a little different, but you should still see similar folders such as `Desktop`, `Documents`, and `Downloads`.

The `ls` command, which loosely stands for "list," lists the contents of a folder.

It looks like there are some folders in here! Let's find out what's inside our `Documents` folder. In order to do so, we'll first navigate to that folder.

```text
$ cd Documents
```

We have now navigated to the `Documents` folder.

The `cd` command, which stands for "change directory," is used to navigate to a particular folder on your computer.

This is equivalent to double clicking the `Documents` folder in Finder to "go inside." We can check that we're in the right place by using `pwd`.

```text
$ pwd
/Users/corneliusfinch/Documents
```

Excellent! Now, let's find out what's in the folder using `ls`.

```text
$ ls
funny_cat_picture.jpg
office_stuff
world_domination_checklist.txt
```

\(Note: Again, you will probably see different files and folders on your own machine!\)

In our example, it looks like the `Documents` folder contains a JPG file of a funny cat, a folder full of "office stuff," and a text file containing a checklist for world domination. Your `Documents` folder probably contains something different.

Now that we've investigated our `Documents` folder, let's return to our home folder. Because the home folder contains the `Documents` folder, we can say that the home folder is the "parent directory" of the `Documents` folder.

```text
$ cd ..
```

> `..` \(two periods, or "dot-dot"\) is how we say "parent directory" to our command line.

Many commands consist of three parts: the command, followed by flags \(a.k.a., options\), and finally, arguments.

```text
$ command -flag -otheroption
```

As their name implies, flags set options to tell the command line how to do what it's about to do. There may be zero or more options. Options usually start with one or two dashes. For the most part, one dash is used for a short, one-letter abbreviation, while two dashes are used for a long name for the option.

[Here's more information about command line options](http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch10s05.html#id2948149).

For example:

```text
$ ls -a
```

Will list _all_ files in a directory, including hidden files \(files whose names begin with a `.`\).

```text
$ cd Downloads
```

Calls the command `cd` to change directories. We provide it with the option of where to navigate.
