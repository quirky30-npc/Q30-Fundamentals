## ![Your Turn](../../.gitbook/assets/exercise%20%281%29.png) Your Turn

Time to try out command line on your own! We've gone ahead and created a new directory for you called `World`. Download it [here](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/assets/activity/World.zip).

When you double click on the zip file, it will create a new folder next to it in your `Downloads` folder.

Now that you can picture where the file is located, open Terminal.

Using the command line alone:

1\) Navigate into your `Downloads` directory.

2\) Move into the `World` directory from the `Downloads` directory.

3\) List the contents of the `World` directory.

4\) In one of the six continents within the `World` directory is a hidden file, `.carmen_sandiego.png`. Using only the command line, find out where in the `World` is Carmen Sandiego.

_Don't delete the_ `World` _directory yet! We'll be working with it in another exercise._
