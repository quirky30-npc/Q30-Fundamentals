# Text Editors and Browsers

## Text Editors and Browsers

There are two main tools to write your code: in a web browser and in a stand-alone text editor.

You may be familiar with doing programming exercises in online applications, such as [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output) and [Codepen](http://codepen.io/). These applications allow you to write code using a web-based text editor. In other words, they allow you to write your code within your web browser. When you're ready to write your code on your own, you'll work in a stand-alone text editor.

Text editors and web browsers are the tools we'll use to build web applications in class and - more importantly - on the job. Watch the video below to learn about these two essential web development tools: text editors and web browsers.
