## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a popular option, an open-source text editor created by the makers of GitHub. There's a great tutorial on how to download, install, and use Atom [here](http://flight-manual.atom.io/). Both these editors are free, so you might consider testing which one you like best. You'll need it \(or another editor like it\) to write code on your own

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a free text editor used by developers. Click [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) to learn how to download, install, and use Sublime Text 3 [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/). 

**Note**

* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) is our preferred web browser, used to demonstrate code rendering throughout the course. If you're not already using it, feel free to download it now!
