# Sublime Text

**WDI Fundamentals Unit 2**

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a free text editor used by developers. Check out the following video to learn how to download, install, and use Sublime Text 3. You'll need it \(or another editor like it\) to write code on your own.

Another popular option is [Atom](https://atom.io/), an open-source text editor created by the makers of GitHub. There's a great tutorial on how to download, install, and use Atom [here](http://flight-manual.atom.io/). Both these editors are free, so you might consider testing which one you like best.

&lt;/div&gt;

**Note**

* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) is our preferred web browser, used to demonstrate code rendering throughout the course. If you're not already using it, feel free to download it now!
