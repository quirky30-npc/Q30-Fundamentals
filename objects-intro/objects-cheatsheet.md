## Objects Cheat Sheet

Here are some notes on what's been covered in this unit. Feel free to copy this and extend it to make your own cheat sheet.

### Collections: Objects

#### Drawbacks of Ordinary Arrays

* A typical array works by referencing elements solely based on their positions, e.g., "the first element, the second element... " etc. But, if the elements are ever rearranged, all of the references to specific elements need to be updated.
* Objects are extremely useful when we want to easily access data. An object generates an enduring relationship between a reference \(called a **key**\) and the value to which it refers.

### Creating Objects

* **Properties** are characteristics associated with an object. In other words, properties tell us about an object.
* Methods are used to represent how people interact with an object in the real world. In other words, **methods** are the actions that can be performed on objects.
* Here's how we would write an object using **literal notation**:

  ```javascript
    var myBicycle = {
      color: "brown",
      model: "DL165",
      make: "Raleigh Competition",
      year: 1976,
      accelerate: function () {
          console.log("Zoom zoom!");
      }
    };
  ```

  * Our object is contained within curly braces `{ }`
  * We are storing our object in a variable, called `myBicycle`
  * We separate each key from its value using a `:`
  * To add a property, we use a property name, such as `color`, `model`, or `make`, followed by a `:`, followed by the corresponding value: `"brown"`, `"DL165"`, or `"Raleigh Competition"`.
  * To add a method, we would use the method name `accelerate`, followed by a `:`, followed by a function \(`function () {}`\).
  * Inside the function, we place any code we want to run when the method is **called**.

#### Accessing Properties

* When working with objects, we can access values using the object name, followed by a period `.`, followed by the name of the property we want to access:

  ```javascript
    // Store "Raleigh Competition" in the bicycleMake variable.
    var bicycleMake = myBicycle.make;
  ```

#### Updating and Adding Properties

* To update and add properties, we use the name of the object \(in this case, `myBicycle`\), followed by a dot `.` followed by the name of the property we want to update or add \(in this case, `color` or `year`\).
* We then use the assignment operator \(`=`\), followed by the new value.

  ```javascript
    myBicycle.color = "white";
    myBicycle.year = 1977;
  ```

#### Accessing Methods

* If we wanted to access — or **call**, our `accelerate` method for our `myBicycle` object — we could do so using the following syntax:

  ```javascript
    // Here we are "calling" the accelerate method.
    myBicycle.accelerate(); 
    // => "Zoom zoom!"
  ```

  * Here, we use the object name `myBicycle`, followed by a period, followed by the method name, followed by parenthesis.

#### `this`

* In the context of our objects, `this` is used in place of the object name to refer to the object.

  ```javascript
    var myBicycle = {
      color: "brown",
      make: "Raleigh Competition",
      getMakeAndColor: function () {
          console.log("My bicycle is a " + this.color + " " + this.make);
      }
    };
  ```

### JSON

* **JSON \(JavaScript Object Notation\)** is a lightweight, text-based data format that's based on JavaScript.
* JSON rules include:
  * Property names must be double-quoted strings \(not single quotes\).
  * Trailing commas are forbidden.
  * Leading zeros are prohibited.
  * In numbers, a decimal point must be followed by at least one digit.
  * Most characters are allowed in strings; however, certain characters \(such as ', ", \, and newline/tab\) must be "escaped" with a preceding backslash \(\\) in order to be read as characters \(as opposed to JSON control code\).
  * All strings must be double-quoted.
  * No comments allowed!
* If we want to send JavaScript objects from a browser to another application, we can use `JSON.stringify()` to convert our objects into JSON format.

  ```javascript
    favoriteMovie = JSON.stringify(favoriteMovie);
  ```

* We can use `JSON.parse()` to process a string containing JSON data. The action converts the JSON data into a JavaScript object.

  ```javascript
    favoriteMovie = JSON.parse(favoriteMovie);
  ```
