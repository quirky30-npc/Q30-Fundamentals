# Creating Objects

**WDI Fundamentals Unit 10**

## Creating Objects

We kicked off this unit with a look at how objects can be used to connect keys with values in JavaScript.

Each object can have its own **properties** and **methods**.

In this lesson we'll explore how we can create an object with properties. In the next lesson we'll learn how to add methods to our objects.

### Properties

**Properties** are characteristics associated with an object. In other words, properties tell us about an object.

Let's look at an example:

If you were to describe a bicycle, you might include its color, make, model and year.

Each property has a name and a value, and each name/value pair tells us something about that individual object.

| NAME | VALUE |
| :---: | :---: |
| `color` | `"brown"` |
| `model` | `"DL165"` |
| `make` | `"Raleigh Competition"` |
| `year` | `1976` |

### Creating Objects

Now we'll learn how to create an object using **literal notation**.

Here's how we would write the bicycle object we detailed above using literal notation:

```javascript
var myBicycle = {
  color: "brown",
  model: "DL165",
  make: "Raleigh Competition",
  year: 1976
};
```

Let's look at the syntax breakdown:

* Our object is contained within curly braces `{ }`
* We are storing our object in a variable, called `myBicycle`
* We separate each key from its value using a `:`
* To add a property, we use a property name, such as `color`, `model`, or `make`, followed by a `:`, followed by the corresponding value: `"brown"`, `"DL165"`, or `"Raleigh Competition"`.

### Accessing Properties Using Dot Notation

Now, let's turn to accessing properties.

We can _get_ and _set_ object properties using **dot notation**.

When working with objects, we can access values using the object name, followed by a dot `.`, followed by the name of the property we want to access:

```javascript
myBicycle.make;  
// => "Raleigh Competition"

myBicycle.color; 
// => "brown"
```

### Updating Properties Using Dot Notation

We can also update values using dot notation.

To do so, we use the name of the object \(in this case, `myBicycle`\), followed by a dot `.` followed by the name of the property we want to update \(in this case, `color` or `year`\).

We then use the assignment operator \(`=`\), followed by the new value.

```javascript
myBicycle.color = "white";
myBicycle.year = 1977;
```

### Adding New Properties

The syntax we use to update a property can also add a new one. If the property we are trying to update doesn't yet exist, it will be added automatically.

```javascript
myBicycle.frameSize = 23.5;
```

We've now added a new property to specify a frame size for our bicycle!

#### Test Yourself

Let's practice!

Refresh the page if you don't see the JS Bin Editor below.

[JS Bin on jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com/qozaziqodu/edit?js,console)

1. In the "JavaScript" panel, create an object called `pet` that has the following properties:

| NAME | VALUE |
| :---: | :---: |
| `name` | `"Rover"` |
| `species` | `"dog"` |
| `favoriteToy` | `"tennis ball"` |
| `age` | `5` |

> After each step, check your answer in JS Bin by hitting the "Run" button in the console panel, and then typing `pet` into the console panel and hitting the enter/return key.

2. Now, how would you assign `6` as the value for `age`?

3. How would you add a new property, `favoriteFood` using the value `"bacon"`?

4. What code could we write to retrieve the value for `name` from the object and store this value in a variable `petName`?

_Check your answer by hitting the "Run" button in the console panel, and then typing_ `petName` _into the console panel and hitting the enter/return key._
