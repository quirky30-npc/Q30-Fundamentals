#### Let's get started!

1. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, create an object `poem` with the following properties:

| NAME | VALUE |
| :---: | :---: |
| `author` | `"Robert Frost"` |
| `datePublished` | `1916` |
| `name` | `"The Road Not Taken"` |
| `famousLine` | `"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"` |

2. Now add a method `quotePoem` to the `poem` object.

3. Inside the method, add a `console.log()` statement, logging the `famousLine` property.

> Hint: You'll want to use the `this` keyword to log out the `famousLine` property for the `poem` object.

4. Now call the `quotePoem` method.

> Hint: The syntax for calling a method looks like this:
>
> ```javascript
> objectName.methodName();
> ```

5. Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" button to test things out!
