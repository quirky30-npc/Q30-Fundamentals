#### Let's get started!

1. In the "JavaScript" panel, declare (create) a variable `myNumber`. Assign it the value `30`. 
	- After declaring the `myNumber` variable in the "JavaScript" panel, be sure to check to make sure you've done things correctly by hitting "Run" in the "Console" panel and then typing `myNumber;` in the "Console" panel and hitting the return/enter key to check its value. You'll want to do this after each step.

	> Note: Ensure the *type* of this value is correct â€” Remember `30` and `'30'` are not the same! Here we want to store a number, so make sure that there are no quotes around the value.

2. Reassign (update) the `myNumber` variable to `20`.
3. Use the `+=` operator to add `5` to the current value of `myNumber`.
4. Now create a second variable `greeting` and assign (give) it the value `"Hello "`.
5. Create a third variable `name` and assign it the value `"Margaret"`.
6. Create a fourth variable `sayHello`. We want the variable to hold the value `"Hello Margaret"`. Use the variables `greeting` and `name` along with the `+` to create this value (referred to as string concatenation).
