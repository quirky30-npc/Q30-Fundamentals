# Layout Basics

At this point in our journey with HTML and CSS, we'll want to start moving things around a bit on our webpage. But before that, we have to understand that HTML elements function and behave differently within the browser. HTML elements can either be `inline` or `block` elements. What's the difference? Is a `header` tag an `inline` or a `block` element? When CSS is applied, how will it render in the browser? These are all questions we'll explore below!

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/5jz9br5kiz?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

#### Checkpoint:

* Which of these are inline elements? block elements?

  * `<a>`
  * `<p>`
  * `<img>`
  * `<strong>`
  * `<h3>`
  * `<ul>`
