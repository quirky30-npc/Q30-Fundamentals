#### Let's get started!

Write the following functions:

1. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, define a function `recitePoem`.
   * Inside the function, log `"Roses are red, violets are blue."` to the console.

     > Hint: add `console.log("Roses are red, violets are blue.");` inside the function.

   * Call the `recitePoem` function in the "JavaScript" panel.

     > Hint: make sure you use parentheses after the function name.

   * Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" panel and you should see `"Roses are red, violets are blue."` displayed in the "Console" panel.
2. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, define a function `playSong`.
   * Inside the function, log `"Cheer up sleepy Jean, Oh, what can it mean."` to the console. 
   * Call the `playSong` function.
   * Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" panel and you should see `"Cheer up sleepy Jean, Oh, what can it mean."` displayed in the "Console" panel.
3. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, define a function `twoByFour`.
   * Inside the function, log `2 * 4` to the console. 
   * Call the `twoByFour` function.
   * Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" panel and you should see `8` displayed in the "Console" panel.

Once you've written and tested all of these functions, go ahead and move on to the next lesson.
