# Exercises, Quizzes & Assignments

## JS Bin Exercises

Fundamentals is interactive! Within every Unit, we've included practice exercises using a code editor \(called JS Bin\) that allows you to practice without leaving the page.

Here's an example. You can type your code directly into the text editor and also click the various tabs \(HTML, CSS, JavaScript\) to type in additional code. The "Output" tab will render your code in real time.

Click on the tabs to get used to the navigation.

Please refresh the page if you do not see the JS Bin Editor below.

> You're required to submit these exercises, you'll want to save your work in case you have questions and want to review these with your instructors.

### To Save Your Code

Creating a free account on JS Bin will allow you to save your exercises as "bins." So make sure to create a [JS Bin account](https://jsbin.com/login). Follow the instructions below to create your JS Bin account and learn how to save your code.

1\) If you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "Save" button on the top left of the JS Bin editor, which will open a new browser.

2\) Log in using a GitHub account. If you don't have one go to the [GitHub Website](https://github.com/) to set up an account. _As of recently, JS bin only accepts GitHub accounts for registration._

3\) Once logged in, if you try to make your changes in any tab, you'll receive the following message.

4\) Now that you're logged in, you can save your code by doing one of the following:

* `File` &gt; `Export` as gist.
  * This will save your file as a GitHub repository on your GitHub! Read more about gists [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/)
* `File` &gt; `Download`. 
  * Download and save your file locally.
* Save your JS bin url. 
  * Simply copy and save your JS bin url for future reference. You can also go to File &gt;My Bins to find the bin. Additionally, you can also `File` &gt; `Save Snapshot` at point in time where JS bin will automatically save the latest version for you on your working copy.

**Pro Tip**: Remember, the code you write in the JS Bin editor will _not automatically save._ Therefore, you need to make sure that you hit the _**save**_ button and make sure you copy your code over.

**Note**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load or shows [JS Bin on jsbin.com](https://jsbin.com/zojica/edit?html,output) in place of the editor, simply refresh the page to load the page again.

## Quizzes

Your progress will be tracked using our unit quizzes. After completing each unit, take the unit quiz to check your understanding of the concepts. When completing the quiz, please use the same email address that you provided for your invoice.

If you want to retake the quiz, just refresh the page! Practice makes perfect.

## Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, where you'll code a **web browser based memory game**. You'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the game, unit by unit! Make sure you are saving your progress along the way. You will learn how to store things locally, and also how to push your code to GitHub for version control!

**Final Submission**: At the end of the project in Unit 11, you'll submit a link to your GitHub repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).

## Grading

While quizzes and assignments won't be formally graded, your local GA team will be checking your submissions to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made the requisite progress before your first week of WDI.

If you have any concerns about your progress, feel free to reach out to your mentor.

## Getting Help

### Ask your mentor!

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, instructors will often help you to drive your own process of discovery, rather than just give you the right answer. You'll also learn to rely on your classmates for support.

## Additional Resources

Shhh. Ok, we're going to let you in on a little secret. Ready?

The exercise answers are at the bottom of the book :\) That's right. If you're stuck, we've supplied exercise solutions to help you work backwards and understand what needs to be done.
