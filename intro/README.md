Dear Quirky30 Student,

**Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!**

Whether you're enrolled to attend classes remotely \(WDIr\) or on campus, prepare for an experience that is as rewarding as it is challenging! There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn before starting WDI. To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming.

We'll cover **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. We'll also learn how to work with standard developer tools \(Text Editors, Browsers, the command line, Git, and GitHub\).

## Time Commitment

The entire ebook is eleven units long, and you should expect to spend between **40 and 60 hours** to complete it. _Please be cognizant that the bulk of this time will likely be spent on Units 7-11, which cover JavaScript fundamentals._ Plan your time accordingly so that you have time to spend working through the Javascript portions!

Make sure you read below before continuing as we've outlined some important tips to keep in mind as you move through WDI Fundamentals!

## Suggestions for Success:

* Set a study schedule for yourself, and stick to it!
  * Ideally, set aside chunks of 2-3 hours at a time so you can get through full sets of lessons and exercises.
* Find a distraction-free workspace.
* Take breaks if you get stuck.  Many developers find taking a walk, talking to a friend, or just taking a brain-break, helps them come back to a problem refreshed and with a new perspective.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help! More on this later...

[Ok, let's get started!](units-and-lessons.md)
