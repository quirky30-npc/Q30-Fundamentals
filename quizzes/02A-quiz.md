*Question 1*

In the command line prompt below, the character labeled with a "B" is known as a tilde ("~") and represents the:

- Name of the computer
- Users Directory
* Home directory
- Parent directory

_Response_

The tilde represents the home directory. This is the folder on your computer containing your Downloads, Pictures, and Documents folders. Each user on any given computer will have their own home folder.

---

*Question 2*

The part of the command line prompt labeled with a "C" (brunomars) represents the:

- Name of the computer
- Home directory
* Username
- Parent directory

_Response_

(C) is the usernameâ€“ it is always located to the left of the '$' on the command line.
---

*Question 3*

The area labeled "D" indicates that:

- The computer is unresponsive
- The last user command is being executed
- The working directory is empty
* The computer is awaiting user input

_Response_

The blinking cursor after the "$" indicates that the computer is ready to accept the user's command.  The computer will not return this prompt until it is done completing whatever task you asked of it.

*Question 4*

What is the name of Ada's working directory at the end of this terminal session?

- adalovelace$  
- adalovelace
- /desktop
* desktop



_Response_

The working directory is "desktop", as you can see in the prompt and the frame of the terminal window. The full, or absolute, path for the "desktop" directory is "/Users/adalovelace/desktop/".

---

*Question 5*
What was Ada's working directory at the _beginning_ of this terminal session?

- desktop
- adalovelace$
- Users
* adalovelace 

_Response_

The working directory was Ada's home directory, "adalovelace".  The full, or absolute, path for her home directory would be "/Users/adalovelace/". This is represented by the tilde symbol ("~") in the first line of this terminal session, before Ada changes her working directory to "desktop".

---

*Question 6*

What does the desktop directory of Ada's computer contain?

- A folder named "ls" 
* Analytical_Engine.txt, scientific_memoirs.pdf, and a directory called "notes" 
- Both of the above 
- The folder is empty

_Response_

From the "desktop" directory, her current working directory, Ada enters the "ls" command. In this context, this command asks for a list of all contents found within "desktop", and the computer returns the names of two files and a folder.

---

_Response_

Adrian lists the contents of his home directory on the third line (remember, the "~" symbol is shorthand for the home directory), and the computer returns two folders or directories, "college" and "images_backup".

---
