*Question 4*

What is the best translation of the CSS rule below?

Hint: Use http://www.color-hex.com/

* Turn all of the paragraph text blue and make the background behind that text black.
- Turn all of the paragraph text blue on a black page background.
- Turn all of the paragraph text blue on a white background.
- Turn all of the paragraph text red and make the background behind that text white.


_Response_

Rememberâ€“ CSS rules will apply to all instances of the selected element, but only within the specified object type. Thus, in this example, the black background color will only affect the area behind the blue text contained in paragraph elements, not the whole page.

*Question 5*

Never separate how your site looks from what your site says. Separating HTML and CSS gives you less flexibility, less versatility, and less scalability.

*Question 6*

According to best practices, class selectors are used to style _________, and ID selectors are used to style _________. 

However, you should avoid using _________ selectors.

- groups of elements | an element that only appears once | class

- an element that only appears once | groups of elements | class
* groups of elements | an element that only appears once | ID
