# Layout Basics

#### By the end of this Unit, you'll be able to:

* Implement the `display` property to determine whether elements are are displayed as `inline` or `block`.
* Use semantic elements to properly organize your page.
* Start taking control of your page layout with `margin`, `padding`, and `borders`.
* Prioritize content based on its placement on a webpage.

## Layout Basics

At this point in our journey with HTML and CSS, we'll want to start moving things around a bit on our webpage. But before that, we have to understand that HTML elements function and behave differently within the browser. HTML elements can either be `inline` or `block` elements. What's the difference? Is a `header` tag an `inline` or a `block` element? When CSS is applied, how will it render in the browser? These are all questions we'll explore below!

### Checkpoint:

* Which of these are inline elements? block elements?
  * `<a>`
  * `<p>`
  * `<img>`
  * `<strong>`
  * `<h3>`
  * `<ul>`
