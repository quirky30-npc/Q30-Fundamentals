## Layout Basics Assignment

Now that we've learned about layout, we're even better equipped to format our HTML and uniquely style our memory game!

### Exercise

#### Requirements

Our game could use some additional styling to make different portions of the page stand out.

In this assignment you will:

* Add structure to the HTML using semantic elements.
* Give the `header` and `nav` a `background-color` to make them stand out.
* Center the `main` content on the page.
* Adjust the spacing around elements using `padding` and `margin` to give the layout some breathing room.

**Below are the steps to complete the assignment:**

1. First let's provide a little more structure to our page. In the `index.html` file for your `memory_game` in Sublime Text, wrap the `h1` with a `header` element.
   * Here's what it looks like to "wrap" an element with another element:

     ```markup
       <header>
           <h1>Memory Game</h1>
       </header>
     ```
2. Now wrap the two navigational anchors — "Instructions" and "Game" — with a `nav` element.
3. Finally, wrap the rest of the content — including everything from the heading that reads "Instructions" to the images of the cards — with a `main` element.
4. Alright! Now that we've added some structure to our HTML content we're ready to add some additional styles. Complete the following steps in the `style.css` file in the `memory_game` folder in Sublime Text.
5. Select the `header` element in your CSS and give it a `background-color` of `#F15B31`, `30px` padding on the top and bottom, and `20px` padding on the right and left.
   * _Check your progress in your browser as you complete each step_. To do so, switch back to your `index.html` file, right-click anywhere within the HTML file, and select the "Open in Browser" option.
6. Some browsers give the body a `margin` by default, which will create a bit of space around the edges of the page. We want to remove this margin since we want our `header` background to touch the edges of the browser window. Apply the following style to the `body` selector in your `style.css` file to remove this margin: `margin: 0;`.
7. Now find the styles you are applying to the `h1`. We also want to remove the margin from the `h1` so that our header takes up a little less space. Set the `margin` for the `h1` to `0`.
8. Now let's add some styles to the `nav`. Give the `nav` element a `background-color` of `#00A6B3` and `20px` padding on the top and bottom.
9. The anchors in our `nav` are a little too close together! Give the `a` elements `20px` margin on the right and left sides.
10. Now let's center the `main` content of our page. Give `main` a `width` of `850px`. Add `35px` margin to the top and bottom of `main` and set the left and right margins to `auto` to center the main section.
11. Our card images also look like they are spaced a little too tightly. Give each `img` `40px` `margin` on the top, and `8px` `margin` on the right and left.

#### Deliverable

Nice — our game is really coming along!
