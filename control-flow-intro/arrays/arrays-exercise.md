### Arrays Exercise

#### Instructions

1. Write the code to perform the actions listed below in the **"JavaScript"** panel in the JS Bin editor. 
2. If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.
3. Click "Run" to run the code in the "Console" panel.
4. After clicking "Run", to check variable values, type the variable name in the **"Console"** panel on the right and hit enter/return.

#### Let's get started!

1. Create a `contacts` array. This array should contain the names `"Matt Smith"`, `"Sam Davis"`, and `"Ashley Jones"`.

   > Note: Be sure to hit the "Run" button and then check your work in the "Console" panel after each step. To check to see what the `contacts` array holds at any point, you can type `contacts;` into the console panel.

2. Create a variable `dad` and assign it the value of the second element \(item\) in the array, `"Sam Davis"`.

   > Hint: remember arrays are _zero-based_ so the first element in the array has an index of `0`. To access the first element in the array, we would use the following syntax: `contacts[0]`.

3. Update the first element in the array. The new value should be `"Mark Williams"`.
4. Use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the array \(`"Ashley Jones"`\).
5. Use the `push()` method to add `"Michelle Johnson"` to the end of the array.
6. Create a variable `numberOfContacts` and assign it the value of the length of the contact array.

   > Hint: you can use the `length` property to get the length of an array.
