## Control Flow Cheat Sheet

Here are some notes on what's been covered in this unit. Feel free to copy this and extend it to make your own cheat sheet.

### Logical Operators and Booleans

**Comparison and Equality Operators**

| Operator | Meaning | True expressions |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| === | Equality | \(2 \* 5\) === 10 |
| !== | Inequality | '10' !== 10 |
| &gt; | Greater than | 20 &gt; 10 |
| &gt;= | Greater than or equal to | '10' &gt;= 10 |
| &lt; | Less than | 10 &lt; 30 |
| &lt;= | Less than or equal to | '10'&lt;= 10 |

**Undefined and Null**

* When a variable is created but is not assigned a value, it will be evaluated as `undefined`.
* We can assign a variable the value `null` as a way to "reset" the value of a variable to "nothing."

**Logical Operators**

Below are the exact rules Boolean operators follow when dealing with non-Boolean input values.

![](../.gitbook/assets/falsey_truthy.png)

* NOT\(`!`\): If the value is _truthy_, return `false`; if the value is _falsey_, return `true`.
* OR \(`||`\): Return the first _truthy_ value; if both values are _falsey_, return the last _falsey_ value. OR is nicknamed the "default operator" \(can you explain why?\)
* AND `(&&):` Return the first _falsey_ value; if both values are _truthy_, return the last _truthy_ value. AND is nicknamed the "guard operator" \(can you explain why?\)

**AND operator `&&`**

| Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| true | true | true |
| true | false | false |
| false | true | false |
| false | false | false |

**OR operator** `||`

| Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| true | true | true |
| true | false | true |
| false | true | true |
| false | false | false |

**NOT operator** `!`

| Condition | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| true | false |
| false | true |

We can use parentheses to change the order of operations for logical operators, just like we do in mathematics.

### Conditionals

#### `if...else` Statement Syntax

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if condition1, condition2, and condition3 are false
}
```

* With `else if`, each additional condition will only be checked if all of the prior conditions have failed.

### Switch and Ternary Operators

#### `switch` Statement Syntax

```javascript
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression is different from both value1 and value2
  }
```

#### Ternary Operator Syntax

A ternary statement is a one-line shorthand for an `if...else` statement.

The syntax for a ternary statement looks like this:

`condition ? result1 : result2;`

Example:

```javascript
var temperature = 55;

var typeOfExercise = temperature >= 45 ? "Go for a run outside." : "Go to the gym.";

typeOfExercise;
// => "Go for a run outside."
```

### Arrays

#### What is an Array?

* An array is an ordered list of values; these values can be strings, booleans, numbers... even other arrays.
* The values within an array, called **elements**, are accessed by their

  position \(via a value called an **index**\) within the array.

* An array can be defined by enclosing a list of values within square braces,

  like so : `var myArray = ['a','b','c','d']`

* To retrieve the value at some index `i` from an array, add `[i]` to the

  end of the array. e.g. `myArray[2]`

* To edit the value at some index `i`, simply act as if you were assigning a variable. e.g. `myArray[1] = 'f'`

#### Additional Array Features

* In addition to storing a set of values, arrays also have a number of in-built properties and functions that they can use.
* `.length` gives you the length of the array you call it on.
* `.push()` adds a new element to the end of an array, and returns that element.
* `.pop()` removes the last element in an array, and returns that element.

### Loops

* Loops are used to tell our programs to take repeated action.

#### `while` Loops

* `while` loops can run indefinitely, so long as the condition remains true.
* A loop's condition is re-evaluated each time the code block finishes running.

The syntax for a while loop looks like this:

```javascript
while (someConditionIsTrue) {
  //A block of code.
}
```

#### `for` Loops

* A `for` loop will generally run a fixed number of times, not indefinitely.
* The three parameters for a `for` loop, in order, are \(1\) an initialization, \(2\) a condition, and \(3\) a final expression.

  ```javascript
    for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
      // A block of code.
    }
  ```

#### Iterating over arrays

* `for` loops are an easy way to iterate through an array. The following will execute an arbitrary function `someFunction` for every element in array `myArray`, from left to right.

  ```javascript
    for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
      someFunction(myArray[i]);
    }
  ```

* To change the way that you iterate through the array, just change the settings of your `for` loop.
