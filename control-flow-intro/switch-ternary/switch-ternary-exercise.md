### Switch Statements and Ternary Operators Exercise

#### Instructions

1. Write the code to perform the actions listed below in the **"JavaScript"** panel in the JS Bin editor. 
2. If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.
3. Click "Run" to run the code in the "Console" panel.
4. After clicking "Run", to check variable values, type the variable name in the **"Console"** panel on the right and hit enter/return.

#### Let's get started!

**Part 1 - Switch Statements**

1. Declare a variable `favoriteMovie` and assign it the value `"star wars"`.
2. Declare a variable `moviePhrase`. It should have no initial value.

   > Hint: The syntax to declare a variable with no initial value looks like this: `var myVariableName;`.

3. Write out a switch statement for the conditions that are written in pseudo code:

   ```javascript
    // If favoriteMovie is "jaws" 
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "You're gonna need a bigger boat." 
    // Else if favoriteMovie is "the shining" 
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
    // Else if favoriteMovie is "star wars"
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "Do. Or do not. There is no try." 
    // Else if favoriteMovie is "forrest gump" 
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "Life was like a box of chocolates."
    // Else if favoriteMovie is "back to the future" 
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "Where we're going, we don't need roads."
    // Else
          // Assign moviePhrase the value "Great movie choice!"
   ```

4. Hit the "Run" button. Then type `moviePhrase;` into the "Console" panel and hit enter/return to check to make sure you are getting the expected result. Try assigning different values to the `favoriteMovie` variable to make sure everything is working correctly.

**Part 2 - Ternary Operators**

1. Declare a variable `hasEmptySquares` and assign it the value `false`.
2. Declare a variable `answersAreCorrect` and assign it the value `true`.
3. Declare a variable `message`. It should have no initial value.
4. Write a ternary statement for the conditions that are written in pseudo code:

   ```javascript
    // If hasEmptySquares is equal to false and answersAreCorrect is equal to true 
          // message ="Crossword puzzle complete!"; 
    // Otherwise 
          // message = "Not quite!";
   ```

5. Hit the "Run" button. Then type `message;` into the "Console" panel and hit enter/return to check to make sure you are getting the expected result. Test out different values for `hasEmptySquares` and `answersAreCorrect` to make sure everything is working correctly.
