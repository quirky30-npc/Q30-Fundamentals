# Intro to CSS

HTML — or **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage — is the standard language used to code web pages and add content to a website. CSS — **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets — dictates how content written in an HTML document looks, including stylistic layouts, colors, and fonts.

In this unit, we'll learn more about CSS and styling to create better designed websites!
