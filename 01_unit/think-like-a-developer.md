## Googling the Error Message
Professional web developers often joke that a third of being a real programmer is just knowing how to find answers on Google. This may be an exaggeration, but the point is not to worry if you ever find yourself scouring the web for the solution to a difficult coding problem. Even professionals do this and it's totally normal.

#### Troubleshooting
When you search Google, it's important to include the programming language you're using in your search query to narrow the results. For example, if you're looking to add an alert function to your page using JavaScript, you should search "alert method JS" or "alert method JavaScript." Only searching for "alert method" will likely provide results that are far too broad.

As you know, Googling something doesn't always lead to a perfect answer or an exact solution. It's equally important to have other online resources and to eventually learn to identify and fix errors on your own.

The video mentions [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/), [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/), and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) as resources for debugging. Professional developers use a number of resources, and may prefer some over others. Below is an additional list of sites developers may reference while working.

#### Resources
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - a highly technical documentation of all things front-end
* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - tool to check markup accuracy
* [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) - tool to check CSS accuracy
* [JSLint](http://jslint.com/) - tool to check JS code quality
* [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,output), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and [repl.it](https://repl.it/) - all great online code editors
