#### Let's get started!
In the exercise for the conditionals lesson, FizzBuzz, we wrote code that took an input, `x`, and set a new `result` value according to a specific set of rules. 

This time, your challenge is to loop through every number from 1 to `max`, applying those exact same rules to each number and, before ending the loop, printing the result out in the console using the command `console.log(result);`.

For reference, if `max` is 20, the following should be displayed in the console:

```javascript
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
17
fizz
19
buzz
```

Testing any number less than 20 should give you a subset of that result â€” in other words, if `max` is 5, we get the following:

```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```
