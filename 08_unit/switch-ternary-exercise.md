#### Let's get started!

##### Part 1 - Switch Statements

0. Declare a variable `favoriteMovie` and assign it the value `"star wars"`.
0. Declare a variable `moviePhrase`. It should have no initial value.

	> Hint: The syntax to declare a variable with no initial value looks like this: `var myVariableName;`.

0. Write out a switch statement for the conditions that are written in pseudo code:

	```js
	// If favoriteMovie is "jaws" 
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "You're gonna need a bigger boat." 
	// Else if favoriteMovie is "the shining" 
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
	// Else if favoriteMovie is "star wars"
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "Do. Or do not. There is no try." 
	// Else if favoriteMovie is "forrest gump" 
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "Life was like a box of chocolates."
	// Else if favoriteMovie is "back to the future" 
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "Where we're going, we don't need roads."
	// Else
	      // Assign moviePhrase the value "Great movie choice!"
	```
0. Hit the "Run" button. Then type `moviePhrase;` into the "Console" panel and hit enter/return to check to make sure you are getting the expected result. Try assigning different values to the `favoriteMovie` variable to make sure everything is working correctly.


##### Part 2 - Ternary Operators
0. Declare a variable `hasEmptySquares` and assign it the value `false`.
0. Declare a variable `answersAreCorrect` and assign it the value `true`.
0. Declare a variable `message`. It should have no initial value.
0. Write a ternary statement for the conditions that are written in pseudo code:

	```js
	// If hasEmptySquares is equal to false and answersAreCorrect is equal to true 
	      // message ="Crossword puzzle complete!"; 
	// Otherwise 
	      // message = "Not quite!";
	```

0. Hit the "Run" button. Then type `message;` into the "Console" panel and hit enter/return to check to make sure you are getting the expected result. Test out different values for `hasEmptySquares` and `answersAreCorrect` to make sure everything is working correctly.
