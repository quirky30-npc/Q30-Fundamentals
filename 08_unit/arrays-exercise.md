#### Let's get started!

1. Create a `contacts` array. This array should contain the names `"Matt Smith"`, `"Sam Davis"`, and `"Ashley Jones"`.
	> Note: Be sure to hit the "Run" button and then check your work in the "Console" panel after each step. To check to see what the `contacts` array holds at any point, you can type `contacts;` into the console panel.
	
2. Create a variable `dad` and assign it the value of the second element (item) in the array, `"Sam Davis"`. 
	> Hint: remember arrays are _zero-based_ so the first element in the array has an index of `0`. To access the first element in the array, we would use the following syntax: `contacts[0]`.
	
3. Update the first element in the array. The new value should be `"Mark Williams"`.

4. Use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the array (`"Ashley Jones"`).

5. Use the `push()` method to add `"Michelle Johnson"` to the end of the array.

6. Create a variable `numberOfContacts` and assign it the value of the length of the contact array.
	> Hint: you can use the `length` property to get the length of an array.
