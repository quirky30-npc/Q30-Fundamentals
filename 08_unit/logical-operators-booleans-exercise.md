#### Instructions

0. Write the code to perform the actions listed below in the **"JavaScript"** panel in the JS Bin editor. 
0. If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.
0. Click "Run" to run the code in the "Console" panel.
0. After clicking "Run", to check variable values, type the variable name in the **"Console"** panel on the right and hit enter/return.

#### Let's get started!


1. In the "JavaScript" panel, declare a variable `flavor` and assign it the value to `"chocolate"`.
	
	> Note: After declaring (creating) each variable, be sure to check to make sure you've done things correctly by hitting the "Run" button and then typing the variable name (`flavor;` in this case) in the "Console" panel and hitting the return/enter key to check its value. You'll want to do this after each step.
2. Create a variable `numberScoops` and assign it the value `3`.
3. Create a variable `outsideTemperature` and assign it the value `75`.
4. Create a variable `price` and assign it the value `3.5`.
5. Create a variable `buyIceCream` and set it equal to an expression that incorporates the following:
	- `price` is _less than or equal to_ 2.5 **OR**
	- `outsideTemperature ` is _greater than or equal to_ 70 **AND**
	- `flavor` is _equal to_ `"chocolate"` **AND**
	- `numberScoops` is _greater than_ `1`
5. After hitting "Run", type `buyIceCream;` into the console and hit the return/enter key to see whether or not you should buy that delicious chocolate ice cream cone under the given conditions.

Next up we'll look at how we can use the operators we learned in this lesson to add logic to our programs. [Here we go!](conditionals.md)
