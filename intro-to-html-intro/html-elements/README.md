# HTML Elements

## HTML Elements

Let's dive deeper into the rules and syntax for writing HTML.

HTML doesn't translate the spaces and line breaks in your code. That's where **element tags** come in!

**Elements** provide the basic structure for any websiteâ€“ they consist of **opening** and **closing tags** and the content in between those tags.

The tags tell the browser exactly what kind of content is being loaded and the basic structure of that content. For example, to create a large heading on a web page, an opening `<h1>` heading tag and a closing `</h1>` heading tag tell the browser that it needs to render the text between these tags as a large block of text. Watch the video below to learn more!

### Checkpoint:

* Which heading tag is larger? `<h3>` or `<h6>`?
* What is the default name for homepages on the web?
* How should you save your HTML file?
* How do you create placeholder for a link?
