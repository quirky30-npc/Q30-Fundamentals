#### Let's get started!

Write the following functions:

0. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, define a function `recitePoem`.
	- Inside the function, log `"Roses are red, violets are blue."` to the console. 
	
		> Hint: add `console.log("Roses are red, violets are blue.");` inside the function.

	- Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" panel and you should see `"Roses are red, violets are blue."` displayed in the "Console" panel.


0. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, define a function `playSong`.
	- Inside the function, log `"Cheer up sleepy Jean, Oh, what can it mean."` to the console. 
	- Call the `playSong` function.
	- Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" panel and you should see `"Cheer up sleepy Jean, Oh, what can it mean."` displayed in the "Console" panel.
