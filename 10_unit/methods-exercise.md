#### Let's get started!
1. In the "JavaScript" panel in JS Bin, create an object `poem` with the following properties:

| NAME  | VALUE  |
|:-:    |:-:     |
| `author ` |  `"Robert Frost"` |
| `datePublished `  |  `1916` |
| `name `  |  `"The Road Not Taken"` |
| `famousLine `  |  `"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"` |


2\. Now add a method `quotePoem` to the `poem ` object.

3\. Inside the method, add a `console.log()` statement, logging the `famousLine` property.

> Hint: You'll want to use the `this` keyword to log out the `famousLine` property for the `poem` object.

	
4\. Now call the `quotePoem` method.

> Hint: The syntax for calling a method looks like this:
> 
> ```js
> objectName.methodName();
> ```

5\. Hit the "Run" button in the "Console" button to test things out!
